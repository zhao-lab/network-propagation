'RBPF_position_large_centralized_CMM' folder implement the centralized CMM
'RBPF_position_large_centralized_CMM' folder implement the decentralized CMM with optimal fusion, by 
minimizing the variance. With slight change, it can simulate decentralized CMM with random fusion.
'StaNAV' contains the codes for GNSS emulation, should not be shared to the public for copyright issue.
